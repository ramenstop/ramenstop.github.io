        <h4 class="yellow"> Yuji Ramen</h4>
        <p>Going to Sorgasburg located by Pier 5 in Brooklyn I was surprised by the ramen I tasted from Yuji.  Always overcrowded, overpriced  hipster/foodie paradise that is Smorgasburg, it was never been too high on my list to go and try any food there. However Yuji’s ramen changed my perspective on outdoor ramen. The uni miso mazemen from Yuji cost around $10 and it was really good considering it was served during a hot July. The creamy sea urchin melted atop the warm, chewy noodles coating them with a rich, briny sauce. It was far richer than I thought it would be, though the blood orange zest and shiso managed to cut the richness somewhat.</p>

        <p>There isn’t much else to say about this ramen because I only ordered one bowl and wanted to try other food at Smorgasburg, but this was one to be remembered. Yuji also has his own ramen joint at Whole Foods near the Lower East Side. However, both his joint in Whole Foods and ramen stand in Smorgasburg has been shut down since he opened up his restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It’s really a shame because his ramen were all unique because it wasn’t provided with any soup based and filled with various tasty sea food spicing and sauce.</p>

        <p>One of my friends however, visited his new restaurant called Okonomi and said that he is still selling his own ramen creations alongside his new restaurant menu. Maybe I should go there and check it out since his ramen was very unique.</p>
