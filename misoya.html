        <p>A little ramen the in East village, Ramen Misoya was unique due to it being a ramen joint focused on miso broth based ramen. Miso is made from fermented soy beans and has a particular smell and strong taste. And it's naturally a bit salty. It is not meant for the weak palette. It's not like the hundreds other tonkotsu broth ramen shops so don't complain that it tastes nothing like them because it's not!</p>

        <p>Their miso ramen was good. I ordered the Shiro Miso Ramen with char shu pork.  You can choose from three kinds of miso and each has its own distinctive taste. I like the concept. It sets this ramen restaurant apart from the others. I admire restaurants that specialize in something and are unique. So I know that if I'm in the mood for miso ramen, I'll come here. They are generous with the portion of toppings and noodle too. The broth was perfect, not overly salty.</p>

        <p>For the topping the char shu pork was delicious. My friend agreed with me that this was the best cooked pork they ever had in ramen! It was not too fatty, well-seasoned, and very moist! My favorite topping in the ramen however was the fried tofu. They give you 2 fried pieces of tofu in the ramen. The tofu is fried thin and crispy/ adds texture to the ramen. Definitely a unique topping to find in ramen bowl and I loved it! Also came with a nice helping of veggies.</p>

        <p>However, service was subpar. We had to sit ourselves and waited some time before a waitress came over to give us menus. Although our meal did come out quick. I don’t mind the wait time since it’s understandable how busy a ramen joint can be during prime time. I will definitely visit again just for the delicious fried tofu and miso broth.</p>
