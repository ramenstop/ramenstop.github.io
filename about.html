        <p class="1text"> Hey this is Ming and currently I'm a college student from New York City. A very diverse city filled with different cultures also means the food here are very unique and broad. One particular food that I am most interested in is Ramen. A combination of noodles with various toppings and miso soup is very delicious. I know it originated from Japan, but recently over the years there has been a lot of different ramen joints opened up in the city.  </p>

         
        
        <p class="2text"> The purpose of this site is for me to write down reviews of the various ramen shops that I visit in the city. This can also be outside the burough of Manhattan, such as Brooklyn or Queens. All of these reviews will be casually written so there may be some grammatical mistakes as well a display of the way I would usually talk to people. I hope that the reviews I write will be helpful to you when you want to figure out what kind of ramen shop you would like to visit in the city. Perhaps my review will also shed some perspective of whether or not it is worth going there to slurp some noodles while enjoying the atmosphere or environment around it.</p>
