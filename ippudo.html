        <p>I’ve been hearing and reading a lot of positive reviews about Ippudo, but I for one still haven’t tried any of the ramen there. I decided to got here on a Sunday night at about 7pm to see what all the rave was about. With my friends we had to wait outside for around 2+ hours. The reviews online weren’t kidding about the long wait to go in. It’s not one of those times where they tell you it’s a super long wait but you get seated in half the time. The wait time was so long that my friends and I went to the Strand Bookstore close by since they call you when your table is ready. You don't have to be outside waiting to go inside, so we had to find something to kill time around the area.</p>

        <p>After 2.5 hours, we were finally seated. They greet you as you walk through, but I didn't know what they were saying, it sounded like garbled yelling probably due to how packed it was during the weekend night. They go have a good service though for a restaurant that was super packed. We ordered and got the food pretty fast. We got the pork buns and the Akamaru modern ramen. The pork buns were delicious and addicting, definitely worth getting. The Akamaru modern ramen was savory and full of flavor. I really liked their broth, it was one of the best I had. I just didn't really like the noodles but that's my personal preference for thicker noodles, their noodles are too thin. In the end was it worth the wait? I’m not really sure, but it was good ramen.</p> 


        <p>I know plenty of people say to stay away from here because its overhyped, it's not worth it, etc.. and I almost want to say that too but really if you're going to come to NY and you have the chance to try one ramen place, then you're not going to choose wrong with Ippudo.</p>
