        <h4 class="yellow"> Ramen Burger</h4>
        <p> Being in New York City you meet a lot of diverse people with different personalities. These personalities can flow through oneâ€™s own work. One person named Keizo Shimamoto decided to mix hamburger with ramen. How crazy is that? I decided to go and check out this special burger.</p>

        <p>A gorgeous sunny afternoon, a pleasant walk to Pier 5, and I was graced with only a few people standing in the Ramen Burger line at Smorgasburg. Judging from the line wrapping around at Home Frite, people have indeed moved on to the next food trend.I've read bad reviews saying that the burgers sit out already made, or the buns and patties languish in cold containers while waiting to be assembled. I'm happy to say none of that was happening when I went. Buns and patties were being cooked on the grill, each burger was made to order and put in a cool looking wrapper.</p>

        <p>I ordered mine with cheese. It was delicious.  The meat was cooked medium, juicy and flavorful. The sauce with the greens and scallions definitely brought out the "ramen" flavor. I liked the buns a lot! Unlike bread buns, which get soggy and fall apart, the noodle buns were chewy and gave great texture, and helped keep the shape of the burger. They aren't seasoned, but I think it's probably for the best as the burger would be too salty otherwise.</p>

          <a class="picture1a" href="images/pictures/ramenburger/ramenburger3.jpg" STYLE="TEXT-DECORATION: NONE"  data-lightbox="example-set" data-title=""><img class="picture1a" src="images/pictures/ramenburger/ramenburger3.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" alt="image-1" /></a>
          <a class="picture2a" href="images/pictures/ramenburger/ramenburger4.jpg" STYLE="TEXT-DECORATION: NONE"  data-lightbox="example-set" data-title=""><img class="picture2a" src="images/pictures/ramenburger/ramenburger4.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" alt="image-1" /></a>
          </div>

        <p>Some people have complained that the buns should be crunchy,not chewy. To me, that's gross, like opening a packet of $1 ramen and eating the hard fried noodle block. Definitely not a replacement for a traditional hamburger, but then again, why would it be? It's clearly a novelty food and meant to be enjoyed as a unique experience on a random weekend.</p>
        <p>You can try your own Ramen burger every weekend at Smorgasburg in Brooklyn or Keizo Shimamoto's ramen joint and order one at Ramen.co.</p>
